        This is only a prototype for ContrAction, so some of the pages and functionalities aren't available yet.  This is just intended to show how different contract types would be selected, and ordinarily you'd be taken to the contract type you selected.  At the moment, only a short-term rental agreement is available, and only from the point of view of the lessor.  To see that contract in action, go <a href = "index.html">back</a> to the start page and select "Renting/Leasing", then select "Yes" when asked if you own the property and "short term" when asked the duration.
