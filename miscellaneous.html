    <p><strong>7.	Miscellaneous.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7.1 Termination.</strong> This Agreement terminates at the end of the Lease Term unless extended by written agreement between the parties.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon a breach of this Agreement by another party, notice of which must be given in writing.  Upon receiving notice, the breaching party will have ninety days to cure the breach.  If the breaching party fails to cure the breach, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party.</p>
    <p><strong>7.2 Merger. </strong>This Agreement constitutes the final, exclusive agreement between the parties on the matters contained in this Agreement. All earlier and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters contained in this Agreement are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>7.3 Assignment and Delegation. </strong>Neither party may assign or delegate any part of this Agreement.  All such assignments or delegations are prohibited, whether they are voluntary or involuntary, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, or any other manner. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this section is void.</p>
    <p><strong>7.4 Severability. </strong>The Landlord shall not enter the Property without notice to the Tenant at least 24 hours prior to the entry.  The Landlord may enter the property without notice during an emergency that threatens to cause irreparable harm to the Property.</p>
    <p><strong>7.5 Amendments.</strong> This Agreement may only be amended by written agreement of both parties.  Such an agreement must explicitly identify itself as an amendment to this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>7.6 Waiver. </strong>No failure or delay to exercise a right, privilege, or power arising from this Agreement by either party may be deemed a waiver of that right, privilege, or power.  Any exercise of a right, privilege, or power arising from this Agreement does not preclude future exercise of that right, privilege, or power.</p>
    <p><strong>7.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. </strong>Each party knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives its right to a trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions it contemplates.  This waiver applies to any legal proceeding, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise.</p>
    <p><strong>7.8 Governing Law. </strong>This Agreement and all matters arising under and relating to it, including torts, are governed by the laws of <input type="text" class= "long" placeholder="The state where you are located">. <button type="button" class="helpicon" onclick="openHelp1()"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i></button> (without giving effects to its conflicts of law principles.  Any adjudication arising under and relating to this Agreement will be conducted in the appropriate trial court closest to the Property.</p>

      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <p>
        The Miscellaneous section is made up of what is often called "boilerplate".  This is the "legalese" that deals with the interpretation of the contract.  Given that a lot of it is standard contract language, you shouldn't change it unless you have a specific reason and know exactly what you're doing.  More specifically:
        <ul>
          <li>The Termination provision explains how the contract can be ended.  In ordinary circumstances, it ends at the end of the Lease Term, but it can also end if either party violates any part of the contract ("breaches"), and doesn't fix the violation within 90 days.</li>
          <li>The Merger provision states explicitly that the contract is the official agreement, and any other agreements, like verbal agreements, don't apply.</li>
          <li>The Assignment and Delegation provision states that each party is responsible for their end of the contract and can't give that responsibility to anyone else.</li>
          <li>The Severability provision says that, if any part of the contract is found to be invalid, it doesn't cancel the whole contract.</li>
          <li>The Amendments section explains how to make changes to the contract, in this case explicitly and in writing.</li>
          <li>The Waiver section says that enforcing the contract is not a "use it or lose it" situation.  In other words, if you choose not to exercise a right, or do exercise it but want to use it later, you still can exercise it at any time.</li>
          <li>The Waiver of Jury Trial section means that, if you take the contract to court, it will be tried by a judge, not a jury.  This is standard because contracts can be confusing, and a judge is more likely to make the right decision than a jury.</li>
          <li>The Governing Law section makes it explicit that the contract will be interpreted under the laws of your home state.  You can choose other states, but using your home state will make it easier for you to find an attorney who can help, if need be.</li>

          This is what state's laws will determine how the contract will be interpreted.  Unless you have specific circumstances where you want another state's laws to apply (you'd know if you did), you should put your own state.  If you have to go to court over the contract, this will make it easier for both your lawyer and the judge, as they'll be more familiar with the laws that apply.
