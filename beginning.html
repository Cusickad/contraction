  <h1>Welcome to ContrAction!</h3>
  <p>
    The contract we'll be drafting is a sublease agreement.  That's a contract where you currently rent a property, but you're having someone assume the lease from you for a period of time.  It's similar to a standard rental agreement in a lot of ways.  We'll walk through all the parts of the contract and how they work.
  </p>
  <h2>What do I need to know about contracts?</h2>
  <h3>What is a contract?</h3>
  <p>
  A contract is a written agreement between two (or sometimes more) parties.  A "party" in this case is a person, business, or organization that is agreeing to something with another person, business, or organization.  A contract memorializes an agreement; in other words, a contract should be a written record of what you're agreeing to, so you should have discussed it beforehand.
  </p>
  <h3>Why should I write a contract?</h3>
  <p>
    In a perfect world, you'd never need a written contract.  Everyone would remember and stick to their promises.  However, this is an imperfect world.  A contract can help you and the other party remember what you each agreed to do.  More importantly, a contract can hold the parties to their agreements.  A contract is a legally binding document, which means that a court can uphold the terms of the agreement.  This means that you shouldn't agree to something you can't or don't want to fulfill, as you can be forced to uphold it.  So, a well-written contract can mean that you can hold the other party to their promises without inadvertently making a promise they didn't mean to.
  </p>
  <h3>What is a makes a good contract?</h3>
  <p>
    To understand what makes a good contract, it's important to know that a contract involves hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.  Ideally, everyone will uphold the terms of their bargain with no issue.  If you're turning to the contract, something has already gone wrong. So, in writing the contract, you need to prepare for things going wrong, which means you'll want to write a contract that courts will interpret in your favor.  Courts generally try to find and uphold what the parties intended to agree to.  As such, a good contract makes it clear what the parties are agreeing on.  Ambiguity is bad, because it means room to interpret what the parties mean.  Your contract should be as clear as possible and state everything that is part of your deal.
  </p>
  <h2>What are the parts of a contract?</h2>
  <h3>Preamble</h3>
  <p>
    The Preamble is the introduction to the contract.  It's where the most basic information about the contract is laid out: what type of contract it is, who it's between, and when it takes effect.  Although you can go into more detail about these elements, making for a longer Preamble, the basic elements are simple.
  </p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    The Background (also called the "recitals") is an optional part of a contract.  It explains why both parties are entering into the deal.  It exists because it can help set the tone for a contract and it can help show the intentions of the parties if there comes a dispute.  That being said, it's not officially "part of the agreement", so you can largely put whatever you want or omit it entirely.
  </p>
  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p>
  The Definitions exist to keep the contract short and simple, or at least shorter and simpler.  Instead of using a phrase over and over throughout the contact, such as always writing the beginning and end of a lease term, you can replace the phrase with one word, which goes in this section. To do so, you state what word you want to use, and explain it's meaning, as shown here.  You can use any word you want to define a phrase (for example, you could call the payment amount "Apple"), but it's always best to choose a word that makes sense in context with the defined phrase. Note that the terms defined before the Definitions section are incorporated by reference, so we don't have to re-define them.
  </p>
  <h3>Action Section</h3>
  <p>
    The Action Section, (the "Lease" section here), is the heart of the contract.  This is where the core deal is hammered out, usually goods or services in exchange for money.  This is where you lay out what is being traded for how much.  If you could only have one section of the contract, this is the one you'd want to keep.  Here, you agree to lease the property, and the tenant agrees to pay rent.  It lays out how rent is paid and the deposit terms.

      This is where you can define your own terms.  If you use a specific phrase several times throughout the contract, you can assign that phrase to a word and then use that word instead of the phrase.  You can use any word to define a phrase, and you can choose to define any phrase, but make sure you use it consistantly throughout the contract.
