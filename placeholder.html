      <p>
        You've reached the end! This is only a prototype for ContrAction, so some of the pages and functionalities aren't available yet.  This page would normally allow you to review the contract as a whole, make large-scale edits, and print the contract.   It would also offer help on some of the next steps, such as negotiating and editing the contract.  Given the technical limitations of this prototype, such features cannot be implemented.  Thank you for taking the time to look at this prototype.
